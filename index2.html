    <p>Hi if you are reading this than that means you either are grading my work or is actually interested in me, programmer wise. Where to begin,  my name is Kevin Hidalgo and I am a web developer in the making and a current full-time student 
        at the UCF coding bootcamp. I was born and raised in the Bronx, New York until August of 2019, in which I moved to Orlando, Florida. 
        Growing up I always had two career paths I wanted to pursue, coder or a cardiologist. Prior to deciding between the two, I chose to purse a career in medicine. I got as far as my junior year, in which it was than I made the difficult decision to 
        change career paths due to some unfortunate events. Thanks to a friend, it was he who introduced me to the concept of a coding bootcamp to jumpstart my career in web development. Tho im still a rookie in the world of web development, I still have
    alot of aspirations to continue learning various language and even go as far as building my own applications from my pocket of ideas that can reach facebook level. Hey, it doesn't hurt to dream big.  </p>
